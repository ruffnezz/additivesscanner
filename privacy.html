  <h1>üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> April 25, 2025</p>

  <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you may provide while using our mobile application <strong>Eat Safe</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    The Eat Safe app uses Google Firebase for authentication. We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal user data, except for technical data required to ensure the app functions correctly (e.g., Firebase ID for login purposes).
  </p>
  <p>
    The app may request access to your device‚Äôs camera for scanning product ingredients (via photo or barcode). The submitted ingredient images are processed on our server <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of analyzing harmful additives. Images are <strong>not stored</strong> or reused.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party technologies and services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> ‚Äì for user authentication and basic app usage analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Food Facts API</strong> ‚Äì to fetch product ingredient data during barcode scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</strong> ‚Äì for extracting text from ingredient images uploaded by users.</li>
    <li><strong>Language Model (LLM)</strong> ‚Äì to analyze and interpret the ingredient text, detect potentially harmful additives, and translate into Russian if needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All data processed by these services (such as ingredient images) is used strictly to provide app functionality and is not stored. We do <strong>not</strong> share data with third parties and do not use it for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    We <strong>do not store</strong> users' personal data. All transmitted data (e.g., ingredient images) is used solely within the app's features and is not saved.
  </p>

  <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop using the app at any time</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app from their device</li>
    <li>Contact us to request deletion of any associated data (should such data ever be collected in the future)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about privacy or data usage, please contact us:</p>
  <p>üìß <a href="mailto:artthaiisht@gmail.com">artthaiisht@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    Our app currently does <strong>not</strong> offer any in-app purchases or subscriptions. While the app‚Äôs manifest may reference potential billing features, these are not active at this time.
